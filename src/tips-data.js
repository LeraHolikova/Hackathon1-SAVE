People who do pick up hitchhikers tend to be very friendly. All the information needed you can find on hitchwiki website and especially helpful is a map with the best spots to get your car.",

    tipTitle: "Getting around",
    tip: "Walking is your best option for saving money.  But if you are doing a lot of sightseeing in different parts of the city,  then a 24 hour ticket might be your best option since it allows unlimited travel for 24 hours from the time you purchase the ticket, and it costs just 8.80 euros for zones A & B.",

    tipTitle: "Places to go",
    tip: "A hop on hop off bus tour does not always have to be expensive. With the 100 bus and a day ticket you can easily do your own city tour, get off at the most important sights or just admire the city as you drive by. Bus line 100 connects many of the city's important sights like Museum Island, the Reichstag, the Brandenburg Gate, Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church and so on.",
    tip: "It’s free to see Brandenburger Tor, the Victory Column, and the TV Tower, and it’s free to admire the East Side Gallery, one of the most popular places to see the Berlin Wall.

And of course there are cheap pizza places and lots of other options.",

    tipTitle: "Where to stay",
    tip: "Couchsurfing is the best way to stay with locals, make lifelong travel friends, or host travelers coming to your hometown. It works by people offering up their sofas, floors, spare rooms and so on for travellers to sleep on for free. It really helps to have someone who knows everything about the city! Moreover there is a weekly meet up every Thursday in Berlin!",
